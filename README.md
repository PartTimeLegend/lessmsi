This is a utility with a graphical user interface and a command line interface that can be used to view and extract the contents of an MSI file. 

To extract from the command line:
	lessmsi x <msiFileName> [<outouptDir>]

For more command line usage see [CommandLine](https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi/wiki/Command-Line).

Features
==========
Windows Explorer Integration
-----
Lessmsi also integrates with Windows Explorer so that you can right-click on a Windows Installer file (.msi file) and select "Extract Files" to extract it into a folder right there:

Just select _Preferences_ from the _Edit_ menu to enable (or disable) the explorer integration:

GUI
-----
In addition to allowing you to extract files from the command line and from inside Windows Explorer, lessmsi has a graphical user interface that allows you to view detailed information about any MSI file.

MSI Table Viewer
-----
Windows Installer (.msi files) are based on an internal database of tables. Lessmsi features a viewer for those tables. Useful for people who work a lot with installers.
